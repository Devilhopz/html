    <body>Guppy, (Poecilia reticulata or Lebistes reticulatus)
         colourful, live-bearing freshwater fish of the family Poeciliidae,
          popular as a pet in home aquariums. ... 
          The male guppy, much the brighter coloured of the sexes,
           grows to about 4 centimetres (1 1/2 inches) long; 
           the female is larger and duller.and its a nature friendly.
           Guppies need light to thrive during the day,
            but constant light can actually kill them.
             Set your tank light on a timer so that it goes out and night 
             and provides the guppies with time to rest and recharge. 
             Provide hiding spots to reduce stress. To keep your fish healthy, 
           they need to feel safe and secure.
